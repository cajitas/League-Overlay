Delve and Syndicate overlays have been modified to include missing fossils and personal opinions / meta shifts designed for the new atlas. I've included sources to this in .PSD format.

If you want to choose a different chart or adjust it for a different resolution, the recommended method is creating a new transparent image same size as your display resolution and sticking the chart guide in the desired position.
